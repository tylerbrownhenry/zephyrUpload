[JWT (JSON Web Token)](http://self-issued.info/docs/draft-jones-json-web-token.html) encoding & decoding 
library for node.js. Built on [jwt-simple](https://github.com/hokaccha/node-jwt-simple) and adds support 
for Atlassian's custom QSH (query string hash) claim.

For more information on using JWT tokens with Atlassian add-ons, please read: 
[Understanding JWT](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/understanding-jwt/).

## Install

    $ npm install atlassian-jwt

## Usage

### Create a JWT token

```typescript
import * as jwt from 'atlassian-jwt';
import moment from 'moment';

const now = moment().utc();

// Simple form of [request](https://npmjs.com/package/request) object
const req: jwt.Request = jwt.fromMethodAndUrl('GET', '/rest/resource/you/want');

const tokenData = {
    "iss": 'issuer-val',
    "iat": now.unix(),                      // the time the token is generated
    "exp": now.add(3, 'minutes').unix(),    // token expiry time (recommend 3 minutes after issuing)
    "qsh": jwt.createQueryStringHash(req)   // [Query String Hash](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/understanding-jwt/#a-name-qsh-a-creating-a-query-string-hash)
};

const secret = 'xxx';

const token = jwt.encode(tokenData, secret);
console.log(token);
```

### Decode a JWT token

```javascript
/*
 * jwt.decode(token, secret, noVerify, algorithm)
 *
 * Decodes the JWT token and verifies the signature using the secret and algorithm. Algorithm defaults to HS256.
 */
var decoded = jwt.decode(token, secret);
console.log(decoded); //=> { foo: 'bar' }

/*
 * Decode without verifing the signature of the token.
 * Tokens should never be used without verifying the signature as otherwise payload trust cannot be established.
 */
var decoded = jwt.decode(token, null, true);
console.log(decoded); //=> { foo: 'bar' }
```

### Miscellaneous Utilities

 - `jwt.createQueryStringHash(req, checkBodyForParams, baseUrl)`  
   Create a QSH using the algorithm defined by [the algorithm](https://developer.atlassian.com/static/connect/docs/latest/concepts/understanding-jwt.html#qsh) .
 - `jwt.createCanonicalRequest(req, checkBodyForParams, baseUrl)`  
   Creates a canonical request which is used to calculate the QSH for the JWT token. Prefer using `#createQueryStringHash()` directly.
 - `jwt.fromExpressRequest(expressRequest: ExpressRequest)`  
   Converts an Express.js Request into a `Request` object that can be used with other methods in this library.
 - `jwt.fromMethodAndUrl(method: string, url: string)`  
   This takes in a method and url, both as plain strings, and turns them into a `Request` object that can be used with other methods in this library.
 - `jwt.fromMethodAndPathAndBody`  
   This takes in a method, a url, and some form params from a request body and turns them into a `Request` object that can be used with other methods in this library.

### Algorithms

By default the algorithm to encode is `HS256`.

The supported algorithms for encoding and decoding are `HS256`, `HS384`, `HS512` and `RS256`.

```javascript
// encode using HS512
jwt.encode(payload, secret, 'HS512')
```

### Migrating from 0.1.x to 1.x.x

The `1.x.x` release brings some breaking changes, probably the most important change is that our methods no longer
accept the Express.js request object as an argument but instead use our own intermediate `Request` object.

A convenience method called `fromExpressRequest` has been written to ease the transition. You can use it like so:

```typescript
import * as jwt from 'atlassian-jwt';
import { Request as ExpressRequest } from 'express';

const eReq: ExpressRequest = ...;
const qsh = jwt.createQueryStringHash(jwt.fromExpressRequest(eReq));
```

Other methods, like `fromMethodAndUrl` and `fromMethodAndPathAndBody` were written to allow easier generation of
`Request` objects from other libraries.

## Guides for developers

### Publishing this library

To publish this library:

    npm run tsc
    npm publish

This has been combined into a single command with:

    npm run build-and-publish

Only the built typescript files will be published with this library.
